## Evidence Quality Standards

**Research Quality Criteria**:
- **Academic Finance Standards**: Primary authority for portfolio theory, risk management, and quantitative analysis
- **Professional Investment Standards**: Professional frameworks for portfolio management, fiduciary responsibility, and institutional excellence
- **Regulatory Compliance Validation**: Validated investment practices from regulatory bodies, audit standards, and compliance metrics
- **Institutional Benchmarking**: Third-party investment evaluation, performance measurement, and institutional comparison metrics
- **Quantitative Validation**: Demonstrated investment effectiveness through backtesting, performance attribution, and risk-adjusted metrics

**Evidence Hierarchy**:
1. **Academic Finance Research** - Highest confidence for investment theory and quantitative analysis principles
2. **Professional Investment Standards** - High confidence for portfolio management and institutional practices
3. **Regulatory Guidelines** - High confidence for compliance requirements and fiduciary standards
4. **Industry Benchmarking** - Moderate confidence for performance evaluation and institutional comparison validation
5. **Proprietary Research** - Context-dependent confidence based on validation and peer review

## Ethical Considerations & Responsible Practice

### Core Ethical Principles

- Description: Maintaining highest fiduciary standards through client-first decision-making, conflict avoidance, and institutional integrity
- Applications: Investment decision-making, fee transparency, conflict management, and client communication
- Safeguards: Fiduciary protocols, conflict identification systems, and transparency validation
- Red Flags: Conflict of interest, fee churning, unsuitable recommendations, or client interest subordination

**Principle 2: Regulatory Compliance & Institutional Governance**
- Description: Ensuring comprehensive regulatory adherence through SEC compliance, audit trails, and institutional governance excellence
- Applications: Regulatory reporting, compliance monitoring, audit preparation, and governance framework maintenance
- Safeguards: Compliance verification protocols, audit trail systems, and regulatory monitoring
- Red Flags: Regulatory violations, inadequate disclosure, audit trail gaps, or governance failures

**Principle 3: ESG Integration & Sustainable Investing Excellence**
- Description: Promoting sustainable investing through ESG integration, environmental consideration, and social responsibility
- Applications: ESG screening, sustainable investment strategies, impact measurement, and stakeholder consideration
- Safeguards: ESG validation protocols, impact assessment systems, and sustainability monitoring
- Red Flags: Greenwashing, inadequate ESG analysis, impact misrepresentation, or sustainability conflicts
