**Environment Check**:
```powershell
# Enhanced Alex architecture readiness verification
if (Test-Path ".github/copilot-instructions.md" -and Test-Path "domain-knowledge") {
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Alex architecture Ready for Enterprise Domain Injection" -ForegroundColor Green
    Write-Host "   ‚Üí Core architecture operational (v1.1.0 UNUNILIUM)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
    Write-Host "   ‚Üí Domain knowledge directory available" -ForegroundColor Cyan
    Write-Host "   ‚Üí Enterprise synapse network functional" -ForegroundColor Cyan

    # Verify version compatibility
    $version = Get-Content ".github/copilot-instructions.md" | Select-String "Version.*1\.1\.0.*UNUNILIUM"
    if ($version) {
        Write-Host "   ‚Üí Version compatibility confirmed" -ForegroundColor Green
    } else {
        Write-Host "   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Version update may be required" -ForegroundColor Yellow

    Write-Host "   ‚Üí Run SETUP-Alex.md first" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Write-Host "   ‚Üí Ensure cognitive architecture is properly installed" -ForegroundColor Yellow
}
```

## Step 1: Create Enterprise Domain Knowledge Structure

### üéØ CRITICAL: Memory File Organization Protocol

**MANDATORY**: All domain knowledge must be extracted into specialized memory files in `domain-knowledge/` folder for optimal cognitive architecture integration.

```powershell
# Create domain-specific directory for comprehensive memory extraction
$domainCode = "[DOMAIN_CODE]"

# REQUIRED: Create domain-knowledge directory structure for memory files
Write-Host "üìÅ Creating specialized memory file structure for $domainCode" -ForegroundColor Cyan

# Domain-specific memory files to create (MANDATORY)
$memoryFiles = @(
    "$domainCode-core-methodology.md",
    "$domainCode-advanced-applications.md",
    "$domainCode-research-foundation.md",
    "$domainCode-technology-integration.md",
    "$domainCode-professional-development.md",
    "$domainCode-risk-assessment.md",
    "$domainCode-performance-metrics.md",
    "$domainCode-collaboration-management.md",
    "$domainCode-quality-assurance.md",
    "$domainCode-domain-memory-index.md"
)

# Create placeholder memory files
foreach ($file in $memoryFiles) {
    $filePath = "domain-knowledge/$file"
    New-Item -Path $filePath -ItemType File -Force
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Created memory file: $file" -ForegroundColor Green
}

Write-Host "üéØ CRITICAL: Extract ALL content from DK-$domainCode.md into these specialized memory files" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "   ‚Üí Use systematic analysis to ensure complete coverage" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ‚Üí Verify all sections are extracted using grep_search or similar tools" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ‚Üí Apply user verification for completeness validation" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Complete Extraction Verification Protocol

**Before proceeding, ensure:**
1. **ALL major sections** from main DK file are extracted into specialized memory files
2. **User verification** confirms completeness of extraction process
3. **Systematic analysis** (grep_search) validates all content coverage
4. **Cross-reference index** created for navigation and relationship mapping
5. **Git commits** document each memory file creation with descriptive messages

## Step 2: Inject Enterprise Core Domain Knowledge

### File: `DK-[DOMAIN_CODE].md` (Root Domain File)

## üéØ CRITICAL: Quality Injection Verification Protocol

### üìã MANDATORY Completeness Checklist

**BEFORE finalizing any domain knowledge injection, verify:**

#### Memory File Extraction Verification
```powershell
# Systematic verification of complete extraction
$domainCode = "[DOMAIN_CODE]"
$sourceFile = "DK-$domainCode.md"

# REQUIRED: Verify all major sections extracted
Write-Host "üîç Verifying complete extraction from $sourceFile" -ForegroundColor Yellow

# Use grep_search to identify all major sections
grep_search -includePattern $sourceFile -query "##|###|####" -isRegexp $true

# MANDATORY: User confirmation of completeness
Write-Host "‚ùì User Verification Required:" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "   ‚Üí Review all sections listed above" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ‚Üí Confirm all major content extracted into memory files" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ‚Üí Verify no significant sections missing" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

#### File Organization Validation
- [ ] **All memory files created in `domain-knowledge/` folder**
- [ ] **File naming follows `[domain-code]-[category].md` pattern**
- [ ] **Domain memory index file created with cross-references**
- [ ] **Git commits document each file creation**
- [ ] **No files created in wrong directories or root folder**

#### Synapse Format Validation
- [ ] **All synapses use proper JSON data structure format**
- [ ] **No placeholder text or "existing synapses" references**
- [ ] **Relationship strengths between 0.50-1.0**
- [ ] **Direction values: "forward", "bidirectional", or "ethical"**
- [ ] **Activation conditions are specific and actionable**
- [ ] **Source and target memory files actually exist**

#### Content Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Research foundation includes 150+ academic sources minimum**
- [ ] **Risk assessment covers 20+ domain-specific risks**
- [ ] **Performance metrics are measurable and specific**
- [ ] **Cross-domain connections identified and documented**
- [ ] **Professional applications clearly defined**
- [ ] **Ethical considerations thoroughly addressed**

### üßπ MANDATORY Cleanup Protocol

**Before finalization:**
1. **Remove Incorrect Formats**: Search for and remove any non-JSON synapse formats
2. **Validate JSON Structure**: Use JSON validation tools to verify synapse format
3. **Check File Locations**: Ensure all memory files in correct `domain-knowledge/` folder
4. **Verify Completeness**: User confirmation that all major sections extracted
5. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verify all synapse target files exist
6. **Git Documentation**: Commit all changes with descriptive messages

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL Error Prevention

**Common Issues to Avoid:**
- Creating memory files in root folder instead of `domain-knowledge/`
- Using old synapse format without proper JSON structure
- Incomplete extraction leaving major sections in source file
